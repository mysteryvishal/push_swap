# push_swap

push_swap is a 42 School algorithmic project focused on sorting integers using two stacks and a strictly limited set of operations. The goal is not just correctness, but optimisation – producing the smallest possible sequence of instructions. This project explores data structures, algorithmic complexity, and practical trade-offs between different sorting strategies, all implemented in C under tight constraints.
