# push_swap
An algorithmic project tackling integer sorting using two stacks and a restricted instruction set. Written in C, the challenge lies in minimising the number of operations rather than just sorting correctly. It focuses on algorithm design, optimisation, and understanding time–operation trade-offs under strict constraints.
